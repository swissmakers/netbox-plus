# Module Bay Types

!!! info "This feature was introduced in NetBox v4.7."

Module bay types are user-defined labels that can be assigned to [module bays](./modulebay.md) and [module types](./moduletype.md) to restrict which modules may be installed into which bays. This is useful for modeling chassis hardware where not every bay accepts every type of line card.

When **both** a module bay and the module type being installed have at least one bay type assigned, NetBox will check for a non-empty intersection. If the two sets share no bay types in common, the installation will be rejected as incompatible.

If either the bay or the module type has **no bay types assigned**, the constraint is not applied and any module type may be installed — this preserves backwards compatibility with existing data.

!!! tip
    Bay types function as an allow-list: assign the same type to a bay and to the module types that fit it, and leave the type unset on bays or module types where no restriction is needed.

!!! note "GraphQL naming"
    In the GraphQL API, the type for the `ModuleBay` *component* is named `ModuleBayType` (following the project's `<Model>Type` suffix convention), while the type for the `ModuleBayType` *model* is named `ModuleBayTypeType`. This is an unavoidable consequence of the naming convention colliding with this model's name.

### Manufacturer

An optional [manufacturer](./manufacturer.md) associated with this bay type. Useful when a vendor uses proprietary slot designations.

### Description
