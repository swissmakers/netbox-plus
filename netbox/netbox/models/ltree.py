"""
Ltree-based hierarchical model support - a replacement for django-mptt backed by
a PostgreSQL ltree column.

LtreeModel covers the subset of django-mptt's MPTTModel API that NetBox actually
uses. It is deliberately NOT a full reimplementation of MPTT's surface — methods
NetBox does not rely on (e.g. get_leafnodes(), get_next_sibling(),
get_previous_sibling()) are intentionally omitted.

Paths are maintained entirely by PostgreSQL triggers installed via the
InstallLtreeTriggers migration operation. The Python layer never computes or
mutates paths directly; it only reads `path` back from the database after
inserts and parent_id changes via refresh_from_db(fields=['path']).

class LtreeModel(models.Model, metaclass=LtreeModelBase):
    """
    Abstract base for hierarchical models backed by PostgreSQL ltree.

    Subclasses must declare a `parent = models.ForeignKey('self', ...)`. The
    `path` column is maintained by per-table triggers installed via
    InstallLtreeTriggers; do not write to it from Python.

    Bulk creates:
        The BEFORE INSERT trigger resolves a row's parent by SELECTing `path`
        from the same table by parent_id. LtreeQuerySet.bulk_create() rejects any
        row whose parent is an *unsaved* instance, so in normal use — parents
        saved before their children are bulk-created — batch order does not matter
        (each parent row already exists for the lookup). The lone exception is
        manually pre-assigned PKs: if a child references a same-batch parent by a
        hand-set pk, that parent must appear earlier in the batch (the BEFORE
        trigger fires per row in list order), or the child gets a root-level path.

    Sort-path on rename:
        For subclasses with the optional `sort_path` column (see
        InstallLtreeTriggers' `name_column` arg), renaming a row updates its
        own sort_path AND cascades into descendants' sort_paths via the AFTER
        trigger. This diverges from django-mptt's `order_insertion_by` (which
        leaves both the renamed row and its descendants stale until a manual
        rebuild) because list views are expected to reflect renames promptly.
        `rebuild_sort_paths()` is still available for bulk repair after raw
        SQL writes that bypass the triggers.

    Concurrency:
        Path maintenance takes no table-wide lock (unlike django-mptt, which
        acquired a per-model advisory lock on *every* write to protect its global
        lft/rght/tree_id numbering). Instead, the BEFORE trigger serializes per
        tree: it takes a transaction-level advisory lock keyed on the root of the
        tree being written (and, for a cross-tree move, on both the source and
        destination roots, acquired in ascending key order to avoid deadlocks).

        Every child insert, move, and reparent of a node in a tree takes the same
        key, so an insert deep in a subtree and a concurrent reparent of one of its
        ancestors are serialized — the loser blocks until the winner commits, and
        the winner's AFTER cascade can never miss a row inserted concurrently
        (which a row-level `FOR SHARE` on the parent could not prevent: a set-based
        cascade's snapshot would skip a row inserted after it began). Writes to
        *different* trees use different keys and proceed fully in parallel — e.g.
        inventory ingestion across different devices, each its own tree.

        Inserting a *new root* (parent_id IS NULL) takes no lock: the uncommitted
        row is invisible to other transactions and has no descendants, so nothing
        can contend with it. This keeps a bulk import of many top-level objects
        (the dominant import pattern) lock-free instead of taking one advisory lock
        per root. The residual case that still scales with volume is inserting
        children into many *distinct existing* trees in one transaction (one lock
        per distinct tree touched); if a very large such import hits "out of shared
        memory", raising the server's `max_locks_per_transaction` is the remedy.

        Two residual, retryable cases remain (PostgreSQL aborts one transaction
        with a deadlock error rather than persisting a stale path): crossing
        reparents (moving A under B while moving B under A), and two concurrent
        *moves* in an ancestor/descendant relationship (a move locks the moved
        row before its BEFORE trigger can take the advisory lock). Plain inserts
        — the high-volume path — never hit this.
