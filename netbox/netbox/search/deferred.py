    holds only the transaction's registered commit callbacks, not one per saved
    object), and reading it fresh each time is what keeps the buffer correctly
    scoped to the live transaction. Django clears run_on_commit on both commit
    and rollback, so a rolled-back transaction's batch can never be found here.

    Matching on `scope` (the savepoint stack active when the callback was
    registered) as well as `alias` keeps each savepoint scope on its own
    callback. Django prunes a callback when a savepoint in its registration
    snapshot rolls back, so an op buffered inside a nested savepoint is dropped
    with its callback if that savepoint rolls back -- it can never be found here

    The inline fallback is safe even during a broker outage: the search index
    lives in PostgreSQL (the extras_cachedvalue table), so a Redis outage only

    If the broker fails mid-enqueue (after the probe succeeds), Job.enqueue() has
    already saved a Job row before the Redis dispatch raised, so the fallback can
