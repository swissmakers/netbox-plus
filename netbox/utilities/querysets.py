def chunked_update(queryset, chunk_size=None, commit_per_batch=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Perform a bulk UPDATE on the given queryset, optionally splitting it into batches of at most
    `chunk_size` rows. Bounding the number of rows touched by each statement avoids exceeding the
    database's statement timeout when updating very large tables. Batches are selected via keyset
    pagination on the primary key and wrapped in a transaction so that the operation remains atomic,
    as it would be when performed by a single UPDATE. Returns the total number of rows updated
    (matching the return value of QuerySet.update()).

    If `chunk_size` is None, it falls back to the BULK_UPDATE_CHUNK_SIZE configuration parameter
    (5000 by default). If that is also None, a single unbounded UPDATE is issued, identical to
    calling queryset.update(**kwargs) directly.

    :param queryset: The QuerySet identifying the rows to update
    :param chunk_size: The maximum number of rows to update per statement (defaults to
        settings.BULK_UPDATE_CHUNK_SIZE)
    :param commit_per_batch: Commit each batch independently rather than wrapping them all in a
        single transaction, forfeiting the atomicity described above. Postgres holds a row lock on
        every row updated until the transaction commits, which for a long-running job spanning a
        large table means blocking concurrent edits for its whole run, so such callers commit as
        they go. Only for updates which can safely be resumed, and only outside an enclosing atomic
        block, which owns the commit regardless -- passed from within one, this silently degrades to
        a single transaction rather than raising, as Django's TestCase wraps every test in one.

        The callers which pass it (see extras.jobs) run in a worker, under a session-scoped advisory
        lock which is taken through a bare cursor, so nothing in that path opens a transaction and
        each batch does commit as intended.
